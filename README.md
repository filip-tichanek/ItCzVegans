# Introduction

This project explores potential signatures of a vegan diet across the microbiome, metabolome, and lipidome. We used data from healthy vegan and omnivorous human subjects in two countries (Czech Republic and Italy), with subjects grouped by `Country` and `Diet`, resulting in four distinct groups.

To assess the generalizability of these findings, we validated our results with an independent cohort from the Czech Republic for external validation.


## Statistical Methods

The statistical modeling approach is described in detail in [this report](https://filip-tichanek.github.io/ItCzVegans/html_reports/478_code04_methods.html). Briefly, the methods used included:

- **Multivariate analysis**: We conducted multivariate analyses (PERMANOVA, PCA, correlation analyses) to explore the effects of `diet`, `country`, and their possible interaction (`diet : country`) on the microbiome, lipidome, and metabolome compositions in an integrative manner. This part of the analysis is not available on the GitHub page, but the code will be provided upon request.

- **Linear models**: Linear models were applied to estimate the effects of `diet`, `country`, and their interaction (`diet:country`) on individual lipids, metabolites, bacterial taxa and pathways ("features"). Features that significantly differed between diet groups (based on the estimated average effect of diet across both countries, adjusted for multiple comparisons with FDR < 0.05) were further examined in the independent validation cohort to assess whether these associations were reproducible.

- **Predictive models (elastic net)**: We employed elastic net (regularized) logistic regression to predict vegan status based on metabolome, lipidome, microbiome and pathways (one predictive model per dataset, i.e.,four elastic net models in total). These models were internally validated using out-of-bag bootstrap resampling. The discriminatory power of each model to differentiate between diet groups was evaluated using the out-of-sample (optimism-corrected) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). The models trained on the training data were then used to estimate the predicted probability that a given subject is vegan in an indepedent validation cohort. This predicted probability was subsequently used as a variable to discriminate between diet groups for external validation.
